# Intro to Github

We as a club noticed that the biggest hurdle for new members to contribute to ACM projects is that they do not know what github is or how to use it. This guide is meant to provide an entry level knowledge understanding of github.

# What is Git and Github

"Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed, data integrity and support for distributed, non-linear workflows." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)

Github is just a website that hosts and shares millions of git projects called repositories. if you haven't already you should create a github acount, and even if you alread have an acount you should look into the github [student pack](https://education.github.com/pack). This pack has a lot of goodies including free server hosting and cloud computing.
